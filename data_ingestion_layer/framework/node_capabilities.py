"""Edge-node capability protocol.

ESP32-S3 boards advertise what they can compute on-device; the server negotiates an
assignment (what each node should compute and send) and fills whatever the node can't do.
This module defines the schema + the negotiation policy. The data plane is carried by
AudioPayload.provided_features (the metrics a node already computed) and consumed by the
voice_metrics gap-filler, which skips the matching server extractors.

Three messages (over MQTT):
  1. advertise  node -> nodes/{id}/capabilities  (retained)  -> NodeCapabilities
  2. assign     server -> nodes/{id}/config                  -> NodeAssignment
  3. data       node -> voice/{user}/{board}/{env}           -> AudioPayload(+provided_features)
