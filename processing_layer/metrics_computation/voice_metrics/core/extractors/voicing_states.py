"""
Voicing States Extractor with Interaction Dynamics Metrics

This module segments audio into voicing states (voiced, unvoiced, silence)
and computes interaction dynamics metrics that are critical for DSM-5
psychomotor assessment.

Voicing States:
- 1 = Voiced (speech with pitch)
- 2 = Unvoiced (speech without pitch, e.g., fricatives)
- 3 = Silence (no speech activity)

Key Interaction Dynamics Metrics:
- silence_ratio: Proportion of silent frames (psychomotor retardation marker)
- speech_velocity: Rate of state transitions (speech fluency)
- pause statistics: Duration and frequency of pauses

Clinical Relevance:
- High silence_ratio: Psychomotor retardation, reduced speech initiation
- Low speech_velocity: Slower, more fragmented speech
- Longer pause durations: Cognitive processing delays

    voiced. Frames that are not voiced are then split into unvoiced vs silence by an
    RMS energy gate.
